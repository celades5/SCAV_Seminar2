# SCAV_Seminar2

Tis readme intents to explain the second seminar in the SCAV subject for the video part.

This repository consists in two parts. First a pdf file which cointants the resolution for the exercises. A python file with a little menu as expected.

**Note:** The menu does not really work, since I did all the exercises through my terminal and screenshot the commands to prove it was done by me.
